# Ruby Basics Project
## Part of The Odin Project's Web 101 course.
Accessible on [their site, here] (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/ruby-basics?ref=lc-pb).

Per their requirements, I have for now only submitted solutions to problems 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 08 and 09.
I downdgraded to rspec 2.14.1 to complete these problems.
